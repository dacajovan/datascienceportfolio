**Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**

Develop a deep learning model to classify images into different categories (e.g., cats vs. dogs, handwritten digits).
Showcase your ability to preprocess images, build CNN architectures, and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

**Sentiment Analysis on Text Data:**

Create a model to classify text sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Experiment with different algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), or transformer models like BERT.

**Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing:**

Use sensor data from machinery to predict when equipment is likely to fail.
Implement time-series analysis techniques and build predictive models to identify maintenance needs before breakdowns occur.

**Recommendation System:**

Develop a recommendation system that suggests items (e.g., movies, products) to users based on their past preferences.
Explore collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**

Create synthetic data using GANs, which can be used for data augmentation or generating realistic images.
Showcase your understanding of GAN architecture and how to train and evaluate GAN models.
Healthcare Predictive Analytics:

Build a model to predict patient diagnoses or medical outcomes based on clinical data.
Emphasize the importance of data privacy and ethical considerations when working with sensitive healthcare data.

**Time Series Forecasting:**

Forecast future values of a time series dataset, such as stock prices or weather patterns.
Experiment with algorithms like ARIMA, Prophet, or deep learning models for time series forecasting.

**Object Detection and Localization:**

Develop a model to detect and locate objects within images or video streams.
Implement popular architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN.

**Interactive Chatbot:**

Build a chatbot that can engage in conversation with users on specific topics.
Utilize natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) techniques to make the conversation more human-like.

**Fraud Detection:**

Develop a model to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data.
Showcase your ability to handle imbalanced datasets and choose appropriate evaluation metrics for fraud detection tasks.
